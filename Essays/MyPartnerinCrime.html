                Writing has always been an essential part of my life. Even before I began studying
                characters, I "wrote," orating as my mom transcribed. From imagining the fate of
                autumn leaves to playing with a dancing tree in the wind, my childhood journals
                kept a record of my pure and unfiltered curiosity about the world.
                <br><br>Soon, I was no longer satisfied with merely asking questions: I attempted to
                answer them by writing fiction. In fifth grade, while learning about the formation
                of clouds in science class, a friend and I wondered what living above the clouds
                would be like. To answer this question, we wrote a novel about a kingdom in the
                sky. As our notebook, torn and tattered from months of writing and editing, was
                passed around the class, I realized my power to create whole new worlds with
                words.
                <br><br>For three consecutive years since fifth grade, I traveled from China to the U.S. for
                summer camps. Journaling in my notebook encouraged me to reflect on cultural
                differences and develop an open mindset. That journal accompanied me as I tried
                weird-looking toast with pepper and salt, attended flying trapeze sessions five
                times a week to film a perfect clip of my knee hang trick, and directed a thriller
                whose plot I barely understood.
                <br><br>As I entered high school, I wrote about studying at an all-girls school, learning
                about feminism, and questioning the correlation between female objectification
                and leg shaving. This time, I was ready to share my thoughts through screenplays
                and films. My reflections on feminism led to a sarcastic film called <i>Who Belongs</i>, in
                which I proposed feminism as a liberation movement for women and men. After
                the film premiered at the All American High School Film Festival, writing remained
                my outlet for curiosity, my wonderland of imagination, and my connection with
                foreign culture, but moreover it had become a bridge between me and mass
                audiences.
                <br><br>Writing, a symphony between thoughts and words, is my precious talent and my
                "partner in crime" as I continue my adventure through the world.</p>
