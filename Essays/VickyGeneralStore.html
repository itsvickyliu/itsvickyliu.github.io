            <p class="card-content">I picked up my heavy, age-old collection of epitaphs — “Vicky General Store's R.I.P. Products” — which I created after reading <i>The Miracles of the Namiya General Store</i>. Flipping through the pages, scribbled with childish drawings of gravestones, I stopped at the last page. The first line read: “#37 An electronic bandage that speeds up the healing of chronic wounds.”<br><br>
            “Mismatch between expectations and abilities. False assumptions. Lack of realistic understanding.” I jotted these comments down. After discovering that “Rest In Peace” is “A Secret Pine” in anagrammatic disguise, I planted my metaphorical secret pine tree in the soil of lessons learned from unsuccessful attempts. From working on a mailbox security concept that was already well-executed in the market, to tenaciously sticking with thermoelectricity as the energy source for my electric band, I realized the importance of transferring knowledge to new contexts, finding perfect balances between ideas, audiences, and abilities. In this fertile land of past mistakes, pine cones grow on my secret pine tree and become stellar products at my creation hub — Vicky General Store.<br><br>
            <i>Vicky General Store's featured product: Vocali, a pathologist-approved speech therapy app that conducts speech drill games, offers speech challenges, and presents educational resources for stuttering children.</i></p>
            One recent product at the Vicky General Store stemmed from my experiences as a stuttering child. Using my coding skills, I created an audio-controlled version of Flappy Bird, changing tedious therapies into engaging gaming experiences, and empowering those who lack access to speech pathologists with at-home treatment. After months of exploring speech recognition algorithms, and weeks of trial and error, the app was published on the App Store and has accumulated over 220 downloads. No longer would stuttering kids face the same painful experiences that I had faced—disdaining themselves as biologically inferior, suffering their peers' mocking laughter, and desperately relying on dreary repetitions to finish sentences.<br><br>
            Excitedly, I embarked on a journey as an empathetic explorer in search of satisfaction and joy, with code and circuit boards guiding my way. Through observation, interviews, research, and iteration, I connected with various communities. I discovered that some Indian motorcyclists lack safe driving habits and cannot afford insurance. To address this issue, I collaborated with two friends at LaunchX to co-develop AllRyde, a tracking app paired with a helmet attachment that gives those with good driving habits discounted insurance premiums. After conversing with game developers and following up with strenuous yet stimulating cycles of data cleaning and sentiment analysis coding, I bred my Python program that allows game developers to identify user sentiment regarding specific game features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I connected with at-home chefs through UPenn's Management & Technology Summer Institute, leading to my creation of a kitchen companion app that automatically updates users' pantry catalogs and provides personalized recipes. Learning from my dad's experience in orthodontics, I coded a dental-treatment consulting app for orthodontists by analyzing past patients' cases.<br><br>
            What unites my diverse collection of products? Technology. Imagine the bits in a computer. That's data. That's information. That's us. Every caring parent, every naughty child, every suffering patient, every diligent worker, every accomplishment and sorrow in human society are all represented by countless 0s and 1s, in an invisible world of computation. Though it lives in tiny devices like microprocessors, technology exerts omnipresent influence. Imagine simply switching the locations of some 0s and 1s, and thereby creating novel tools to foster familial connectedness, to alleviate patients' pain, or to protect workers' safety. As I continue to absorb knowledge, master skills, and learn from my R.I.P. product epitaphs, I will eventually turn my dream into reality: becoming a social innovator for all, with keen eyes, a resilient mindset, and a warm heart.<br><br>
