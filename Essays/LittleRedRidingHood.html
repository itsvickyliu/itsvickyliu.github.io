            I am a wolf living in the Amazon Rainforest in the 21st century. Today is my twentieth birthday, and I decided to write a memoir about myself.<br><br>
            Time flies back to ten years ago. The only creatures that I knew at that time were wolves, but I actually didn't like them. They were devoted carnivores who could not live a day without meat. Strangely, I didn't find any interest in meat; instead, vegetables were delicious to me. But these wolves always said to me: “You are so stupid! It is a pleasure to eat meat. How can you refuse to do that!”<br><br>
            One day, the wolves told me: “Go and hunt a prey to show us your power. Or we will never play with you. Nobody wants to play with timid friends.”<br><br>
            I knew I was not a coward, but I didn't want to annoy them. They would even eat me if they were angry at me. So I answered: “Sure. I will bring back an animal within two days.”<br><br>
            I left the wolf pack and headed west. Even though the wolves only asked me to catch a prey, I knew they would force me to eat it. So I wanted to find a tiny prey, a snail would be fine. Before I met the first snail of the day, I encountered a creature with a broken red cloak. But the creature didn't notice me. Even though mud was all over the creature's body, I cried out in my heart: “I am so fortunate to meet a little girl! Last time I met a human was five years ago. No, she is not simply a little girl. I need to give her a name. Hmm, she is the little red riding hood. Can I be her friend? Oh no, I cannot forget my mission. It is more important for me to maintain a good relationship with the wolves because I will spend most of my life with them but not the little girl.”<br><br>
            Therefore, I acted as it was planned. Mimicking the way that other wolves acted, I went to the little red riding hood and smiled at her in a trickery way. I said: “Hello my little girl. Are you okay? It seems like you are tired.” Little red riding hood said: “Oh yes, Mr. Wolf. It is my first day in the Amazon Rainforest, and I am lost. My home is at the border of the Amazon Rainforest, but I cannot find it.” I was glad that little red riding hood trusted me so easily, and she was far away from her house. I responded: “Well, you are now in the middle of the rainforest. It must be so tiring for you. Why don't you come to my house for a rest, and I can take you back to your house tomorrow.” Little red riding hood answered yes sweetly.<br><br>
            On the way back, we decided that I would call her little red riding hood, and she would call me Mr. Wolf. Even though I was glad that we established a connection, it made the decision to bring her to the wolf pack harder. I thought: “I am so cruel that I am bringing such an innocent girl to the mouths of wolves.” I stopped before my brain realized it.<br><br>
            Little red riding hood said: “Mr. Wolf, why do you stop? Is there anything wrong?” She looked at me with her big doe eyes. I felt guilty and knew that I couldn't hide any more. I responded: “Little red riding hood, I ask for your forgiveness. I am hiding the truth from you. I am not taking you to my home to rest, but I am taking you to a wolf pack where everybody wants to eat you. It is a courage test that they set for me, and I need to please them.” Little red riding hood was shocked, but she calmed herself down quickly. She questioned: “Then why didn't you eat me? You had so many chances.” I said: “I am a strange wolf. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just don't want to eat meat. I love vegetables. Well, you can find your home if you keep walking North. I am going to catch another animal and give it to the wolves.” Little red riding hood smiled and said: “No. It is not wrong to refuse eating meat. It is your own choice, and you should be confident about it. You don't need to disobey your true will in order to please these wolves. I used to think that I was a weird girl, too. I was more interested in playing with animals. By the way, this is why I easily believed in you. But I was asked to play with humans everyday. Finally, I decided to be crazy one time when I told my parents that I wanted to live in the Amazon Rainforest for two months. Therefore, I can fully devote myself to an animal world. It is too short for humans' lives to please everybody and ourselves, so we should dare to be true and place pleasing ourselves as the main goal. Even though most people thought I was crazy, my parents supported me. Therefore, I am here. Come! I will take you to my grandma who has the power to change your organs to fit a vegetarian life.”<br><br>
            Without giving me time to think, she sat down and began to murmur words that I couldn't understand. Suddenly, an amiable fairy appears. She held a wand that was similar to the one that Harry Potter had. The fairy said: “Oh my little granddaughter, what brings you to me?” Little red riding hood cried: “Grandma, can you help Mr. Wolf? He wants to be a vegetarian, but his body structure doesn't allow him to do so.” The fairy smiled and said: “Sure, my granddaughter.” She put her wand on my stomach and stared at it. It was strange for me, for I felt nothing. Within five seconds, the fairy removed her wand and told me it was done. She disappeared after she finished her work without letting me to thank her.<br><br>
            After this incident, I left the wolf pack forever and led the little red riding hood to her home. I lived with her for the two months that she was in the forest, and we made a lot of new friends together. Even though these new friends were scared of me at first, they became close with me after they found out I was a vegetarian wolf. I have never felt lonely again even after the little red riding hood left, for I have so many friends that accept my true self. By the way, I have found some vegetarian wolves, too. I need to end the story here because tomorrow the little red riding hood will visit me, and I need to prepare food for her.
