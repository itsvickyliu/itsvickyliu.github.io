                In July 2018, the four of our team members met at the Stock Market course in the Columbia Summer Immersion Program, where we learned about the basics of investments and participated in a three-week stock market trading simulation game. Some of us were risk-takers and bet our stocks on FDA approvals and quarterly reports, while others were more prudent, taking one step at a time to ensure a smooth increase in the portfolio's value. Despite our differences as young investors, we quickly bonded through a common interest in the world of investments. Wanting to continue exploring this field after the summer program, we decided to participate in Knowledge@Wharton Investment Competition as a team called Trade Tigers.<br><br>
                Once registered for the competition, we realized that our team was at a disadvantage. Living in two different countries, four different cities, and two different time zones, our biggest challenge was communicating effectively. Unlike other teams consisting of members from the same school or the same area, we did not have the privilege of seeing each other on a daily basis. As a result, our communication tools were limited to Messages and FaceTime, and we were easily disconnected if we didn't reply to each other. Different school schedules caused a lack of communication at the beginning of the competition, and we had a low output of work since we waited for each other's replies before moving on to the next task. As a result, by the end of the first week into the competition, we established the rule that everybody was to reply to each other's messages within 48 hours. We also decided to call each other on a weekly basis and more often before the submission of the mid-term paper and the final report. Nevertheless, different school schedules helped facilitate the division of work among us, which was a blessing in disguise. When we were writing the mid-term paper, we divided the team into a weekday team and a weekend team based on each person's schedule. People who were more available on the weekends wrote the draft for the paper in a single block of time, and people who were free on the weekdays spent a short period of time each day editing the paper and asking for advice. As a result, we all finished our tasks on time without being overloaded. Using rules to foster communication and using our limitations to our advantage, we managed to come up with a well-planned investment strategy for our client Sachin Rekhi.<br><br>
                Our investment strategy is to maintain Sachin Rekhi's portfolio at a moderate risk level by objectively investing in socially and environmentally-friendly companies with sustainable business models and a secured position in its market niche based on our Companality Test. As Warren Buffett stated, “If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money.” Therefore, we aimed to invest objectively by developing our own Companality Test that categorizes companies based on their suitability for investors from four aspects. In addition, we focused on companies that bring positive social and environmental influences to the world. Even though these impacts may not directly result in a high capital return, they have long-term global benefits. Since Sachin Rekhi is an entrepreneur dedicated to changing the world, investing in socially and environmentally-friendly companies is one of the most direct ways to achieve this goal. Sachin Rekhi's risk preference and expectation for return would have been crucial in forming our investment strategy. We tried to directly contact him by sending a questionnaire, but he was not available for comment. Consequently, our investment strategy was formed based on the assumption that he would prefer a moderate-risk portfolio. Since only one out of ten startups will succeed (Griffith), Sachin Rekhi, an entrepreneur who will retire in around thirty years, would prefer a less-risky portfolio to balance out the risk he already takes. As a result, we left 15% of our capital as cash while trading the remaining 85% in the stock market to reduce the risk associated with the stock market's volatility. In order to diversify the portfolio, we included around 80% of domestic stocks and 20% of international stocks, similar to the domestic to international stocks ratio in the approved stock list. Sachin Rekhi would also like to invest in a few short-term risky companies with a higher capital return due to his annual commitment to the ASPCA. Therefore, the portfolio includes around 80% of long-term stocks and 20% of short-term stocks. Accordingly, we chose three relatively stable sectors for long-term investments, which are energy, healthcare, and producer durables, and one volatile sector, which is technology, for short-term investments. All in all, Sachin Rekhi's moderate-risk portfolio consists of altruistic and healthy companies that were chosen by our objective Companality Test.<br><br>
                One essential part of our investment strategy is the Companality Test, inspired by the 16 Personalities Test and designed to examine individual companies' suitability for investors from four aspects. The test classifies companies into sixteen types based on four binary groups of characteristics, which are defensive (D) and cyclical (C), altruistic (A) and egoistic (E), healthy (H) and experimental (X), and mature (M) and young (Y). The name of each type is composed of four letters that refer to a specific characteristic in each binary group. D companies have products or services that meet people's physiological and safety needs, such as food and medicines. C companies have products or services that fulfill people's psychological and self-fulfillment needs, such as mobiles and video games. A companies place social and environmental impact over capital return, while E companies value capital return more. H companies have developed sustainable business models and found their market niche, while X companies have not yet. M companies are older than or equal to the average age in their sectors, while Y companies are younger than the average age.<br><br>
                We used four questionnaires to determine a company's four-letter identifier, each corresponding to a binary group of characteristics. Since our definition for each characteristic is mostly qualitative, the four questionnaires have quantitative questions to eliminate our prejudice against certain companies. For instance, we asked “How many educational or outreach programs does the company provide for youth?” as opposed to “How well does the company cultivate future leaders?” We developed the questionnaires based on theories, models or generally recognized goals, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
                One substantial difference between the Companality Test and other analysis tools is that our test does not categorize companies as simply good companies or bad companies. Since the test classifies companies based on their characteristics, there are companies that suit a specific investor based on their risk tolerance and expected return and companies that currently do not fit them. For instance, a risk-taker may invest in an X company in the hope that its value will skyrocket once it finds its market niche and sustainable business model. However, this type of company does not fit investors who want to use stocks as a stable stream of income since it is highly possible that the X company will fail to find a spot in the market. As a result, our Companality Test is a tool for categorizing companies based on their suitability for investors as opposed to a measure of black and white definitions.<br><br>
                After categorizing companies into sixteen types, we decided which types of companies were best for Sachin Rekhi's investment based on the historical performance of the companies and his risk tolerance and expectation for return. As a result, our investment decisions are objective and the stock portfolio is customized. Since Sachin Rekhi can positively impact the world by investing in socially and environmentally friendly companies, we focused on the eight types of A companies for his customized portfolio. Then, we collected the monthly quote of each A company during the recent economic recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, and the recent economic expansion from July 2009 to October 2018 to see which type of company held strong during these times. Statistically, DHAY, CHAY, DHAM, and DXAM companies performed better than the other four types, and specifically, CHAY companies earned the most during the economic expansion. Since the portfolio is designed to have 80% less-risky long-term investments based on Sachin Rekhi's age and occupation, we eliminated X companies due to their inherent risk related to their unstable foundation for future growth. As we found that the age of the company does not fully determine the strength of its stock, having a mix of them is best for the diversification of the portfolio. Therefore, we decided to invest in DHAY and DHAM companies for long-term and CHAY companies for short-term investments. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, other types of companies may still be appealing to investors who have different goals than that of Sachin Rekhi.<br><br>
                After choosing the types of companies to invest in, we decided to use OTIS as a platform to test our investment strategy. Our portfolio didn't earn returns during the trading period, which included one of the worst stock dips of the last five years. However, we are confident that our portfolio will generate short-term gains as well as long-term profits in the future. Using our short-term portfolio consisting of CHAY companies, the average annual yield would have been 31% for the past twenty years, and the portfolio's annual returns outperformed that of S&P 500, a well-known stock market index, for eighteen out of those twenty years. Using our long-term portfolio consisting of DHAY and DHAM companies, the average decadal return would have been 386% for the past thirty years, and the decadal returns outperformed S&P 500's by at least 261%. Therefore, our short-term and long-term portfolio will be as profitable as they would have been in the past despite recent ups and downs.<br><br>
                Nevertheless, we realized one shortcoming in our decision making process that prevented us from performing better during the trading period. Even though the Companality Test guided us to choose the types of companies we should invest in without bias, we didn't have an objective process in choosing individual stock holdings. To solve this problem, we plan to develop a Stockality Test that eliminates overvalued stocks of qualified companies based on key financial ratios. Therefore, stocks of qualified companies after taking the Companality Test and the Stockality Test will form our revised portfolio for Sachin Rekhi.<br><br>
                Even though our Companality Test has developed into a company suitability test for investors, it was far from perfect when we had first started. Early in the competition, we were thinking about developing a scoring system and ranking each company from 1-100 based on its strengths and weaknesses. However, as mentioned before, what one investor considers a company's strength may be considered as a weakness by another investor. Therefore, this idea was soon abandoned as our team's goal was to create an effective company evaluation system that could be used by all investors with different intentions.<br><br>
                Later, we decided to categorize companies based on four binary groups of characteristics instead of judging each company, so investors have the freedom to choose the category of company they want to invest in based on their specific investment goal. In order to decide our four binary groups of characteristics, we researched the companies in our sectors and listed the companies' characteristics we noticed. Then, we divided these characteristics into two categories: objective and subjective, and we chose two groups of characteristics from each category to form the four binary characteristics groups. After carefully defining each characteristic, we developed a comprehensive, quantitative questionnaire for each group of characteristics to ensure the objectivity of our investment decisions.<br><br>
                Currently, we are continuing to develop the questionnaires and the classification system for our Companality Test. Our next step is to not only use it ourselves but also make it accessible to all kinds of investors, especially beginners. We have already made some progress toward this goal. We developed an Investorality Test for investors who want to get a sense of their risk tolerance and expectation for return. After answering ten multiple choice questions in our Investorality Test, people can utilize the Companality Test to choose companies that best suit their interest. Moreover, we simplified the wording of our Companality Test questionnaires since novice investors are often overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of finance glossaries. Additionally, we have classified companies in four sectors, including energy, healthcare, producer durables, and technology, into sixteen types of companies, and we will continue doing that in order to create a database for our Companality Test. Therefore, investors who don't want to spend the time taking our Companality Test can directly choose companies from our database. Finally, we will publish our tests, including the Investorality Test, the Companality Test, and the Stockality Test, on a free-access website, so people around the world can utilize these tests to make better investment decisions.<br><br>
                For people who don't want to put their money into the volatile stock market, we have made efforts to educate them about finance. We have built an online artist community called FinArt Studio with members posting artworks related to finance glossaries every other day. The Instagram account of FinArt Studio is finart_studio. These artworks, including paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, and videos, explain investment concepts to people who are not necessarily interested in numbers and graphs. The finance term that artists are currently working on is “investor”. We defined it as a person who offers money to others and expects financial returns as they generate profit. The investor can endure present loss of money due to expected future gain. We have given the artists the freedom to choose the theme of their artwork as long as it is related to the definition of an investor. As a result, the artists have come up with numerous works in multiple forms of media. For instance, an artist created an engraving of a plant. He explained that the initial investment from an investor is like the seed of a plant, and its vines grow as the value of the asset increases. FinArt Studio will be beneficial to people who want to learn about investing.<br><br>
                We understand that financial education requires collaboration, so we have constantly offered help to other teams who are also dedicated to raising financial literacy. Vertex Investment Club, a Canadian team which participated in the 2016-2017 Knowledge@Wharton Investment Competition, will launch a podcast on investments in January 2019. They were looking for an artist who could design a logo with the name of their podcast on it. Since we got to know many artists from FinArt Studio, we recommended an artist in our community to design the logo for them. With an attractive logo and instructive content, we are confident that the podcast of Vertex Investment Club will help young investors substantially.<br><br>
                Prior to participating in Knowledge@Wharton Investment Competition, we have competed in other stock market competitions; however, it was the KWHS investment competition that allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the capital market and grow as young investors. In the other competitions, our sole goal was maximizing capital return during a short period of time. We bought and sold stocks numerous times per day in order to utilize every opportunity in the volatile market to earn money. However, KWHS taught us that in real life, good investments are long-term gains instead of short-term wins. We learned to look deeper into a company's operation and analyze it as a whole, as opposed to constantly staring at the current price of a company on a computer screen, waiting for it to rise. We learned to restrain our desire to buy and sell stocks frantically during a volatile market. From our practice of investing in socially and environmentally-friendly companies, we also learned that a good investment is about using money effectively and efficiently to support companies that will bring meaningful changes to the world. Consequently, it was harder for us to make investment decisions during this competition. Instead of being the sheep in the market by buying high-performance companies that are featured on <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> or <i>The Economist</i>, we needed to make rational investment decisions. At the end of the day, we each benefited tremendously from this opportunity to rethink our participation in and our understanding of the world of investments.
