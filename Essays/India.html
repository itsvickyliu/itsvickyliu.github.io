            As one of the film industries with a large annual production number, Bollywood plays a crucial role in reflecting the local culture through its films' storylines and themes. The belief in male preference influences the local culture in India. As research in 2012 showed, 59.8 percent of married women who were living in the countryside in India considered having two or more sons favorable, while only 23.3 percent of women preferred to have two or more daughters (Pande). The belief that men bring more economic returns and girls require more supervision led to this phenomenon. Firstly, sons can sustain their families, mostly when their parents are old, while parents need to pay for their daughters' dowries when they get married (Pande). Even if a daughter can earn a living herself, her parents are afraid to ask for money, as they don't want to annoy their daughter's husband (Abhinand). Furthermore, 86.6 percent of people who were raped in India during 2012 were females younger than thirty (National Crime Records Bureau 83); a daughter's parents have an extra duty to guard her against those rapists (Abhinand). Consequently, Bollywood actresses are obligated to represent this male preference in society, and thus, face multiple problems. Bollywood films emphasize the stereotype of an ideal Indian woman and often contribute to mental illness and sexual harassment for these actresses.
            <br><br>One of the obvious ways that gender inequality is shown is in the imbalance of the number of female and male characters in Bollywood films. Only 24.9 percent of characters in the movies are female, and it is one of the lowest percentages around the world (Smith 3). Producers in Bollywood believe that people go to watch a movie when the main character is a man; as a result, they produce fewer films with prominent female roles, for the profit of a movie is the most critical evaluation of a production's success (Bhushan).
            <br><br>Even when the films include female roles, they are not treated with dignity. To begin with, female characters are uninfluential in the storyline of the movies. A stable ratio from 1970 to 2017 showed that the movies' plot descriptions mentioned male roles twice as many times as female roles (Madaan). On certain occasions, the principal character seems to be a female, but the capability of a male character to help her is often highlighted by the film (Bhushan). For instance, the daughter Megha in <i>Mohabbatein</i> committed suicide in order to change her father's opinion about love; nevertheless, the role of Megha was simply a phantom who led her boyfriend to take the crucial step in saving her father (Ramkissoon 57). Moreover, producers use females as a way to attract viewers. Even though 80 percent of the movies focus on male characters, over half of their posters put the spotlight on female roles (Madaan). In addition, male roles have more respected jobs compared with females. Almost one-third of male characters are doctors, but only three percent of female characters have this occupation (Madaan). Lastly, actresses portray characters that are less developed because they are shaped based on their looks and their connections with the male characters. Women in the movies are more likely to be described as attractive and the daughters of males, while men are often depicted as successful (Madaan). As a result of the lack of focus on female characters in Bollywood films, they become roles who serve males and who preserve the belief in the superiority of males (Gupta).
            <br><br>Therefore, Bollywood filmmakers and producers created a stereotype of female characters as a way to reinforce male dominance. There is a cultural rule in Indian society that females always belong to others. As a daughter, she belongs to her father; as a wife, she is the property of her spouse; and as a mother, especially after the death of her spouse, she belongs to her children (Ramkissoon 54). As a result, the daughters follow their fathers' orders in the movies. Even though the man in the film <i>Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai</i> was engaged with Anjali, a traditional Hindu daughter, he went to a party with a prostitute; nevertheless, Anjali was asked to marry him, for he asked for the forgiveness of her father (Ramkissoon 56). The daughter's action of obedience gave her father a sense that he was in control of everything. This film reminds male viewers of their abilities to control their daughters. Similar to the role of a daughter, a wife has to be loyal to her husband and her family-in-law. Kiran, the widow in <i>Mohabbatein</i>, could not dance for her own pleasure anymore after her marriage. At the same time, she did <i>Karma Chauth</i>, a religious event where wives starved themselves for one day until their husbands fed them when the sun went down, for her father-in-law did not believe his son was dead (Ramkissoon 58-59). Through all her sacrifices and her fasts, she devoted enough respect to her husband that the family required. This film shows the extent of devotion that men can expect from their wives. Moreover, the mothers exist to work for her family. The mother, Bobby, in <i>Hum Tum</i> had to move to Paris with her daughter's family even though she preferred to live in India (Ramkissoon 60). By providing all the necessities the family needed, the pride of her son-in-law increased with a well-kept home.
            <br><br>Not only does Bollywood show the positive endings of obedient female characters, but also it presents the tragic endings of women who violate the ideal female image. <i>Cocktail</i> conveys the belief that women are unworthy to be honored if they don't observe the cultural rules. In the movie, Veronica, who was a self-sufficient and unconventional woman, fell in love with Gautam, a boy who possessed similar characteristics. However, she chose to be tamed by the culture in order to be liked by Gautam's mother. Nevertheless, Gautam married a traditional Indian woman in the end (Haridas). Through this film, female viewers are taught to be conventional throughout their lives if they want to live happily with their lovers.
            <br><br>Along with these flat female characters Bollywood movies have created, the films highlight women's appearance to meet the male audiences' taste. In the past, males preferred a female who could display a series of hints about her fertility, such as “full lips, clear skin, smooth skin, clear eyes, lustrous hair, and good muscle tone” to ensure the survival of their families; consequently, these features became the criteria for stunning females (Buss). A widely accepted movie called <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</i> reinforces the idea that a woman's appearance determines her future. The male protagonist found his love for the female protagonist when she wore a feminine dress (Gupta). Bollywood films shape 25.2 percent of the female characters to be physically charming with 34.1 percent of them wearing sexually related clothing (Smith 8). For example, Ishika Dhanrajgir in <i>Mohabbatein</i> continued wearing clothes that showed enough parts of her body to get male audiences' interests after her decision to become conventional (Ramkissoon 65). However, the standard of beauty slightly changed as actresses came in contact with the Western culture. Early actresses like Zeenat Aman could become prominent stars with voluptuous body shapes; nowadays, the pursuit of a skinny body has become the trend (Singh). As a result, Bollywood actresses like Sarah Jane Dias did not get the roles that they wanted, for they were not thin enough (Kokra).
            <br><br>After actresses recognize the importance of their physical features in Bollywood films, they start to self-objectify to survive in the industry through a two-step process. Firstly, the workers in the industry help to improve the actresses' looks to meet the audiences' expectations. In order to complete the first step, the actresses need to objectify themselves as unqualified products that need improvements. Secondly, the stars that have been properly designed are allowed to produce movies as a way to earn their living (Dyer 5). Bollywood music that compares women with objects such as food and balm adds to the actresses' negative opinions upon themselves (Dwivedi 403).
            <br><br>Mental consequences of female self-objectification include anxiety and depression among actresses. The public is consistently exposed to an environment where a wonderful female needs to be young, slim, and fair. Nevertheless, only one out of 40,000 females can attain a model's physical appearance; therefore, it is common for actresses to feel shame about their bodies (Fredrickson 181). Consequently, anxiety occurs when they receive negative judgments about their looks (Fredrickson 182). Moreover, depression arises when anxiety bothers these actresses. On one hand, actresses worry they are powerless, which results in depression, based on the learned helpless theory which states that people feel depressed when they realize they cannot control anything. Actresses are powerless in controlling their own physical characteristics, and they cannot manage others' opinions about them (Fredrickson 188). On the other hand, actresses choose to restrain their true characteristics as a way to be liked by audiences. As a result, they get depressed, for they constantly behave in a way that others feel content about, but it is not the way that they want to be (Fredrickson 187). Deepika Padukone, a notable Bollywood actress who experienced depression, claimed that she had to pretend to be fine when she was not (Padukone).
            <br><br>Another effect of self-objectification is actresses' desire for slim bodies and participation in extreme dieting without realizing the limits of their bodies (Calogero). One Bollywood actress took pills and did not balance her diet after she had suffered a setback because of her body shape. She starved herself for three weeks in order to prove her worth in the industry by showing a slim body (Kokra). In addition, females are less likely to improve their lifestyles based on their body hints such as hunger cues and stomach aches than males, for they are less sensitive to those hints (Fredrickson 184).
            <br><br>Moreover, males in Bollywood are more likely to commit sexual harassment when female self-objectification is the norm. The belief of females that they are objects provides males an excuse to do anything to them, for they don't view themselves as independent people (Stoltenberg 39). A victim of rape once said the rapist told her he could rape her not only because she was a woman, but also because she was absent when he wanted her (Stoltenberg 12). Specifically, this phenomenon has a higher possibility to occur in the film industry. The jobs of actresses are insecure, for the workplace is competitive with tens of thousands of new actors and actresses coming each year. As a result, actresses utilize the open secret that sexual affairs can exchange jobs to secure their roles (Safi). Swara Bhaskar, an outstanding Bollywood actress, lost her role when she declared she would not get her job by having a sexual affair with any directors. Furthermore, directors have multiple excuses to meet with specific actresses alone, such as pretending to see her for auditions and to communicate with her about the scenes that will be shot in the films (Safi). However, there is little news about sexual harassment in Bollywood, for actresses rarely stand against it in public due to the potential destruction of their careers (Koechlin). A film director named Sohan Thakur touched a Bollywood actress when he called her for an audition, and she could not tell others, for she did not want to lower her reputation (Safi). As an old Chinese saying goes, “It is hard to be the first person to eat the crabs.” Similar to the situation that nobody wants to taste the dangerous creature, not enough influential Bollywood actresses have protested against sexual exploitation to attract the public's attention because they fear retribution (Koechlin).
            <br><br>As can be seen, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and the exploitation of actresses are the results of attempts to portray the female ideal in Bollywood movies. Nevertheless, actresses are becoming stronger people. Bollywood films have begun including outstanding female characters. For instance, <i>Lipstick Under My Burkha</i> was a story about four women who solved their personal problems. At the same time, an action movie called <i>Naam Shabana</i> depicted a female spy, which was a character that females were least likely to act (D'Cunha). Furthermore, actresses have realized that males objectify them. Actress Kangana Ranaut produced an epic dance number video to satirize how males in Bollywood look down on females by including lyrics like “objectify even my wrists” (Mohata). In addition, Bollywood celebrities have started to fight against depression. Not only did the Bollywood star Deepika Padukone establish The Live Love Laugh, an organization that is trying to draw public awareness to depression, but also she talked in public about her own depression (Padukone). Similarly, a Bollywood actress overcame her eating disorder by understanding that a fit body was more important than a thin body (Kokra). These Bollywood actresses should band together and start a movement that is dedicated to changing the general female image in Bollywood films. Consequently, they would have a greater influence on the industry and would be more successful in making positive changes.
