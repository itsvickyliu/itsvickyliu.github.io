                I have a best friend named Levin. You cannot see him with your own eyes but he always follows me. He became my friend at a Halloween party about one million years ago.
                <br><br>I made a face mask of Levin last night and I brought it here today. I wanted all my friends in this class to get to know him.
                <br><br>First I made a circle. That is Levin's face. He's got a green face because he wanted to look scary.
                <br><br>Then I made two purple horns which stick out straight. Levin does not have hands. He uses his horns to give me a pat on the back when I am a good girl.
                <br><br>Levin has two big and round eyes protected by his bright and red eye-lashes. He can always find me even in the darkness.
                <br><br>Next comes to his sharp teeth and a loooooong tongue. He's got really red teeth and tongue. Guess why? He is a blood-sucking monster born at the midnight of Halloween. He protects me from evil spirits wherever I go.
                <br><br>There is something missing on his face. Oops! I forgot his nose. Don't worry. I dug a hole right in the center of his face. That's his nose. Now he can smell all the goodies you hide in your pockets.
                <br><br>I love Levin and Levin loves me!
