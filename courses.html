                    College is both harder and easier than I thought. It's hard because, unlike high school, even the easiest courses I take still need me to devote a considerable amount of time. It's easy because transition from high school to college for most people is similar to my transition from middle school to high school, so I didn't really need to deal with homesick, living with peers instead of family, etc. again. To maintain a good balance between work and life, I intentionally left one day of the weekend for work and one day for fun, which worked pretty well.

                    I realized that I attend college because I want to meet interesting people, so two guiding principles I summarized: 1. Take more courses that I can get personalized attention 2. Join clubs that allow me to meet people from other majors.

                    This is the toughest semester for me both physically and emotionally. I could no longer easily stay in the top tier in terms of academics, social, or health anymore. I also spent a lot of time doing things to fit in instead of following my passion, which drained a lot of energy as well. I was sitting in a corner of Gates one day after finishing all the midterms and met a long-time-no-see friend. We talked a lot, especially about the possibilities to shoot films together, and that literally made my week. Even though I have been taught that I should do what I'm passionate about since young, it's so easy to unknowingly start doing things just to fit in. This is indeed a process that requires me to constantly introspect and correct the path I take.
